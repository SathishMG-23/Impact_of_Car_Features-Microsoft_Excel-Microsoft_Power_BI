# Impact_of_Car_Features-Microsoft_Excel-Microsoft_Power_BI

I'm excited to share my latest data analytics project where I explored the automotive industry, focusing on factors that drive consumer demand for cars. By leveraging my skills in Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint, I was able to derive actionable insights that can optimize pricing and product development decisions for maximum profitability.

## Objective
To understand how a car manufacturer can optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.

## Key Insights
* Brand Popularity: 'Ford', 'BMW', and 'Audi' lead the way, while 'Genesis' and 'Spyker' trail behind.
* Fuel Type: 'Flex-fuel (unleaded/E85)' and 'natural gas' engines are top favorites.
* Engine HP: Most popular HP ranges from 650-700, despite no direct correlation with popularity.
* Transmission: 'DIRECT_DRIVE' transmissions reign supreme.
* Driven Wheels: 'Four-wheel drive' is the preferred choice.
* Doors: 3-door vehicles top the charts in popularity.
* Vehicle Size & Style: 'Large' vehicles and 'Passenger Vans' are most sought after.
* Mileage: High mileage correlates with popularity.
* Price Range: Most popular cars fall in the 6 Lakhs to 6.5 Lakhs range.
* Market Category: 'Diesel' and 'Flex Fuel' categories dominate.

### This project has honed my skills in data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization, and I'm eager to bring these insights to a dynamic team as a Data Analyst.
